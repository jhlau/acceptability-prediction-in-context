# Human Ratings
- Collected human ratings without context, with real context and with random context are in the csv files under **human-ratings**.
- These are filtered and preprocessed ratings with outliers removed (detailed in the last paragraph of section 2.1).
- Column names in the CSV files should be self-explanatory
  - _translated_ means whether the sentence has undergone round-trip machine translation, 1 indicates yes and 0 otherwise
  - _source-langage_ is the intermediate language of the round-trip machine translation (always "en" if _translated_=0)
